Day 1: Dating with hypergamy
Kata Level: 5 Kyu

Problem Description
====================
A number of single men and women are locked together for a longer while in a villa or on an island, for the sake of a TV show. Because they spend quite some time together, all of them seek a partner to date. They are all shallow people, and they only care about looks, aka physical attractiveness when it comes to dating. Looks levels range from 1 to 10.

The unwritten rules for their choice of partner are the following:

Women never date men below their own looks level
Women are content with one partner, and when they have it, they don't look for a second man (yeah, I know, but let's assume this for this kata)
Because women are hypergamous, they never settle for a man who's not at least 2 levels above their own, unless he's an 8 or above (but even then, the first rule applies)
Men of level 8 or above (aka Chads) try to get 2 women, men below that are content with one
When women have a choice between two equally glamorous Chads, they prefer the one without a girlfriend
Both women and men try to get the best looking date(s) they can get
These rules have nothing to do with reality of course.

You'll be given a list of looks levels representing the men, and another list representing the women. Return a list of the looks levels of the men who stay alone, sorted from hideous to handsome.
